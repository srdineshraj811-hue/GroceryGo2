   * Footer containing common links (Contact, Terms, Privacy, social icons, address).

2. **Typography & Color**

   * Match fonts (heading font, body font) used on MyHomeGrocers.
   * Use brand‑color palette (primary, secondary, accent) consistent with the original.
   * Use appropriate spacing, margins, and padding to mimic the original’s look and feel.

3. **Product Listing / Collection Pages**

   * Hover states / image swap on hover if applicable.
   * Filters (by category, price, rating, etc.) and sorting options.
   * Pagination or infinite scroll as used in the original.

4. **Product Detail Page**

   * Large product images (with zoom / lightbox) + gallery thumbnails.
   * Product title, price, description, variants (size, color, etc.).

   * Responsive and mobile-friendly forms.

6. **Search & Navigation**

   * Search bar with live suggestions / autocomplete.
   * Breadcrumb navigation on internal pages.
   * Drop‑down menus or mega menus if used originally.

   * Mobile menu (hamburger) with functional menu items.
   * Touch-friendly elements (buttons, form fields).

8. **Performance & SEO Optimization**

   * Optimize images (lazy loading, responsive sizes).
   * Use best practices for CSS, JS bundling and minimizing.
   * Semantic HTML, meta tags, structured data (product schema).
   * Fast load times (target < 2 s).

9. **CMS / Admin / Content Management**

   * Use a CMS (e.g. WordPress + WooCommerce, Shopify, or headless) so content (products, banners, text) can be updated easily.
   * Admin interface to manage products, categories, orders, pages.

    * Provide design mockups (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    * Deliver assets (icons, image sources, fonts, style guide) to developers.
    * Provide CSS / style guide (colors, typography, spacing).

12. **Testing & Quality Assurance**

    * Cross‑browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
    * Responsive testing.
    * Functional testing (cart, checkout, forms).
    * Accessibility (WCAG compliance basics).

**Additional Notes / References:**

* Use the URL I gave (MyHomeGrocers) as a reference for layout, spacing, UI elements, and flows.

* Ask me for clarifications on any section (typography, colors, spacing) once mockups are ready.

If you like, I can generate a version of this prompt formatted specifically for Replete (with placeholders) and with design spec sheets. Do you want me to generate that?
